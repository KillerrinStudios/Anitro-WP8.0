A girl at his school, Saeki Nanako, is his muse and his Venus, and he admires her from a distance. One day, he forgets his copy of Les Fleurs du Mal in the classroom and runs back alone to pick it up. In the classroom, he finds not only his book, but Saeki's gym uniform. On a mad impulse, he steals it.\nNow everyone knows \"some pervert\" stole Saeki's uniform, and Kasuga is dying with shame and guilt. Furthermore, the weird, creepy, and friendless girl of the class, Nakamura, saw him take the uniform. Instead of revealing it was him, she recognizes his kindred deviant spirit and uses her knowledge to take control of his life. Will it be possible for Kasuga to get closer to Saeki, despite Nakamura's meddling and his dark secret? What exactly does Nakamura intend to do with him?\n(Source: MangaHelpers)","show_type":"TV","genres":[{"name":"Drama"},{"name":"Romance"},{"name":"Psychological"},{"name":"School"}]},"rating":{"type":"advanced","value":null,"valueAsDouble":0.0}}␟{"episodes_watched":"0","last_watched":"2013-07-04T03:51:26Z","rewatched_times":"0","notes":null,"notes_present":null,"status":"dropped","id":"966cfa0f10f223204386ae30bb7885c2","private":false,"rewatching":null,"anime":{"slug":"rdg-red-data-girl","status":"Finished Airing","url":"/anime/rdg-red-data-girl","title":"RDG: Red Data Girl","alternate_title":"Red Data Girl","episode_count":"12","cover_image":"http://static.hummingbird.me/anime/poster_images/000/007/182/large/7182.jpeg?1383500506","cover_image_uri":"http://static.hummingbird.me/anime/poster_images/000/007/182/large/7182.jpeg?1383500506","synopsis":"A modern fantasy based on Japanese Shinto legends.Suzuhara Izumiko is a 15-year-old girl,who has been raised and protected in a shrine deep in the Kumano mountains.She is quite shy and destroys all the electric devices she touches.When she begins to think about going out of the mountains and moving to the city,her guardian Sagara Yukimasa recommends her to enter a high school in Tokyo and forces his son Miyuki to serve Izumiko for life.Miyuki and Izumiko repel each other but their relationship begins to change when a terrifying accident occurs on the school excursion.Izumiko learns her fate as the last representative(yorishiro)of a Himegami goddess and Miyuki learns of his duty as a guardian Yamabushi of Izumiko.\r\n(Source:MAL)","show_type":"TV","genres":[{"name":"Fantasy"}]},"rating":{"type":"advanced","value":null,"valueAsDouble":0.0}}␟
